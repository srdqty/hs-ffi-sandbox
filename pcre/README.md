This is based on the example from Real World Haskell with slight changes to use
Monoid for option values and Text instead of Data.ByteString.Char8.

See: http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/interfacing-with-c-the-ffi.html

```
./run.sh
```

## TODO

* Validate whether utf8 support is working as expected or not
