# struct

This is an example of working with a C struct via the Storable type class in
Haskell, using hsc2hs to generate the sizeOf, alignment, and offets. I wonder
if even more boilerplate can be eliminated by using c2hs...

This is based on the example here: https://wiki.haskell.org/FFICookBook#Working_with_structs

```
./run.sh
```
