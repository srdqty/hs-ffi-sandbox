# struct

This is an example of working with a C struct via the Storable type class in
Haskell, using c2hs to generate the sizeOf, alignment, and offets. For this
example, at least, using cs2hs seems to be about the same as using hsc2hs.

This is based on the example here: https://wiki.haskell.org/FFICookBook#Working_with_structs

```
./run.sh
```
